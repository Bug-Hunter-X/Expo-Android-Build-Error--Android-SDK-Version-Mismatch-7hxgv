To resolve this issue, ensure the correct Android SDK is installed and configured. This typically involves:

1. **Check your project's `android/app/build.gradle`:**  Ensure the `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, and `targetSdkVersion` are compatible with your available Android SDK versions.

2. **Use the Android SDK Manager:** Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessible through Android Studio's SDK Manager) and review the installed packages. Install or update the necessary packages to match the versions specified in your project's `build.gradle`.

3. **Clean and rebuild:** After making changes, clean your project and attempt the build process again.  Sometimes a clean build will resolve discrepancies.

4. **If problem persists:** Provide detailed error logs and your SDK versions in an Expo community forum for further assistance.
